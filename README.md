# Tableau Project: Sales Comparison by Region

## 📊 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and comparing sales performance between two selected regions using **Excel data** and **Tableau**.  
The dashboard enables stakeholders to visualize key sales metrics, identify performance gaps, and make informed business decisions.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop an interactive Tableau dashboard that compares regional sales performance based on key indicators such as total sales, average order value, customer count, and number of products sold.

## 🧩 Dataset
- **Source:** Excel file (local data source)
- **Dataset Used:** Sample Superstore (Sales data)
- **Key Fields:** Order ID, Customer Name, Region, Sales, Quantity, Profit, Order Date

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Imported Excel dataset into Tableau.
2. Created a hierarchy for *Country* under a new field **Location**.
3. Designed **parameters** for *Primary Region* and *Secondary Region* to enable user-driven comparison.
4. Built **calculated fields** to compute KPIs such as:
   - Total Sales  
   - Average Sales per Order  
   - Number of Customers  
   - Number of Orders  
   - Number of Products Sold  
   - First Order Date  
5. Combined multiple visualizations into a single **interactive dashboard** for side-by-side comparison.
6. Added filters, legends, and dynamic visuals for better interactivity.

## 💡 Key Insights
